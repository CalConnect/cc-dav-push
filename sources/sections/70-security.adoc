== Security Considerations

To prevent abuse of the service, Push Gateways SHOULD require either servers or
clients or both to authenticate. Servers SHOULD authenticate every request of
Protocol #2 via HTTP.

Push Gateways use the `<gateway-data>` information to authenticate subscription
requests from a Server by relating them to Client authorization requests.
Clients will typically be authenticating to Servers to access protected data on
the server and thus SHOULD authenticate when using Protocol #1.
