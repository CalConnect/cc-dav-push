==== Bootstrapping

----
; root element
root {
        push-transports
}

; a list of push transports supported by a gateway
; in the request sent by the application server this is empty
push-transports "push-transports" [
        * transport
]

transport "transport" {
        ; The uri of the transport.
        "transport-uri" : uri,
        transport-data?
}

; optional data the client needs to know in order to subscribe
; to allow easy conversion to other formats,
; this object MUST NOT contain structured data.
transport-data "transport-data" {
  ^"": any
}

==== Subscription

[source]
----
; root element
root {
        push-subscribe
}

; the object describing the subscription
push-subscribe "push-subscribe" {
        topic-list,
        selected-transport,
        expires
}

; The list of topics to subscribe to. Unless a previous
; subscription is updated by a request, existing
; subscriptions won't be affected by new subscriptions.
topic-list "topics" [
        * topic
}

; The chosen transport type
selected-transport "selected-transport" {
        ; The transport-uri of the chosen transport
        "transport-uri" : uri,
        ; The client-data string as sent by the client
        "client-data" : string
}

; The time of when the subscription expires
; must be a UTC timestamp following
; https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339
expires "expires" : RFC 3339 timestamp
----

==== Update notification

[source]
----
; The root object
root {
        "push" [ 1* message ]
}

; A message object, describing the update
message {
        topic,
        ? priority,
        timestamp,
        ? client-id
}

; The topic of the resource that has been updated
topic "topic" : string

; The priority of the change, with 0 being the lowest and 100
; being the highest priority
; If omitted, implementations SHOULD default to 50.
priority "priority" : integer 0..100

; The time of when the change occurred. The value MUST be a
; timestamp in UTC following https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339
; If the server aggregated multiple updates before sending the push
; message, this MUST be the timestamp of the most recent update.
timestamp "timestamp" : RFC 3339 timestamp

; An optional id that identifies the client that triggered the update
; notification. Push gateways can use this information to suppress
; push messages to this particular client, in order to avoid
; unnecessary sync operations.
; If the server aggregated multiple updates from different clients
; into one message, it MUST omit the client-id to ensure all clients
; receive the push message.
client-id "client-id": string

; root element of the push subscribe response
root {
        ? no-subscribers-list
}

; A list of topics without active subscribers.
; Applications servers SHOULD not send further push messages for the
; enlisted topics to this transport unless a new client subscribes on
; this transport.
no-subscribers-list "no-subscribers" [
    1* topic }
]
