* https://calconnect.github.io/cc-dav-push/[CalConnect+IETF: Calendaring and scheduling -- Push Discovery and Notification Dispatch Protocol (HTML)]

== General

This document describes the Push Discovery and Notification Dispatch Protocol,
which is a protocol for discovering push notification support in a CalDAV server
and for subscribing to push notifications.

The protocol is based on WebDAV and is designed to be used with CalDAV servers
that support push notifications.

The protocol is designed to be extensible and to support multiple push
notification transports.

The protocol is designed to be used with the CalDAV Scheduling Extensions to
WebDAV (CalDAV-SCHED) and the CalDAV Managed Attachments Extensions to WebDAV
(CalDAV-ATTACH) protocols.
